**Prompt C: PRD Review, Clarification, and Edge Case Identification**

This phase focuses on ensuring the `PRD.md` is clear, complete, and unambiguous before moving to detailed technical design.

```markdown
I am initiating the development of a free open-source browser extension called "Tabitha" under the GPL 3 license. The project will be hosted on GitHub, with support via GitHub Issues and Discussions.
I have two foundational documents:
1. DesignProposal.md (outlining the project's vision and high-level design concepts)
2. PRD.md (a detailed Product Requirements Document specifying features, functionalities, and constraints)

[PASTE CONTENT OF DesignProposal.md HERE]

--- END OF DesignProposal.md ---

[PASTE CONTENT OF PRD.md HERE]

--- END OF PRD.md ---

Now, based on these documents, I require your assistance with the following activity within the Requirements phase of development:

**Activity:** Requirements Validation and Elaboration
**Role:** You are a meticulous Business Analyst and Product Owner.
**Task:**
1.  Thoroughly review the provided `DesignProposal.md` and `PRD.md`.
2.  Identify any ambiguities, contradictions, or areas where requirements in the `PRD.md` might be unclear, incomplete, or could lead to misinterpretation during technical design and implementation.
3.  List potential edge cases or specific user scenarios related to the features described in the `PRD.md` that might not be explicitly covered but are important for ensuring robust functionality (e.g., behavior with extremely large numbers of tabs/collections, interactions during sync conflicts, accessibility nuances for complex UI components like the Recycle Bin's lineage highlighting).
4.  Formulate a list of specific questions for the project lead (me) to clarify these points, ensuring the `PRD.md` is as robust as possible before detailed technical specification begins.
**Constraints:** Focus on strengthening the `PRD.md` to serve as a solid foundation for the subsequent Technical Specification and Implementation phases.
**Output Format:** A Markdown list of questions, numbered consecutively, and for each give  the ideal or best practice answer(s).
