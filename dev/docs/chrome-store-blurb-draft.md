Too many tabs open all the time? Can't find what you were working on? Tabitha helps you group related tabs together, so you can easily find what you need for different things.

Too many tabs? Can’t instantly get back to what you were doing? Tabitha helps you instantly switch tasks and quickly recall the mindset you were in.

Having a lot of browser tabs permanently open might feel convenient, but it can slow down your computer, drain your laptop’s battery faster, make it tougher to find what you need, and if your browser doesn't shut down properly, you could lose these tabs.

1.  **Overwhelmed by too many tabs:**
    *   **What it is:** Users open numerous tabs, leading to a cluttered browser, difficulty finding specific tabs, and reduced browser performance.
    *   **Tabitha provides:** A system to save these open tabs into organized **Workspaces, Folders, and Groups** as **Saved Link Items**. This allows users to close the actual browser tabs, decluttering their tab bar while keeping the information accessible.

2.  **Need to switch between different projects/contexts easily:**
    *   **What it is:** Users work on multiple distinct tasks (e.g., "Work Project A," "Personal Research," "Client B") and need to quickly access all relevant online resources for each context without manually re-opening everything.
    *   **Tabitha provides:** **Workspaces** which are "isolated containers for distinct projects or themes." This allows users to create a dedicated space for each context and switch between them seamlessly.

3.  **Want to save links and information for later in an organized, visual way:**
    *   **What it is:** Users find valuable web pages, articles, or resources they want to revisit. Standard bookmarks can become messy, and leaving tabs open is inefficient. They prefer a more structured and visually appealing way to store these.
    *   **Tabitha provides:** The ability to save links as **Saved Link Items** (and add **Notes**) within a clear hierarchy of **Workspaces > Folders > Groups**. The **Groups Panel** offers multiple **View options (List, Cards, Compact, Board, Grid)**, catering to different visual organization preferences.

4.  **Appreciate a cleaner browser and improved focus:**
    *   **What it is:** A cluttered digital environment (like a browser with too many tabs) can be distracting and reduce concentration. Users want a tidier workspace to focus better.
    *   **Tabitha provides:** By enabling users to save and organize tabs into its system, they can close many active browser tabs. This results in a cleaner browser interface, reducing visual distractions and aiding focus.

5.  **Value productivity enhancements for web browsing:**
    *   **What it is:** Users look for tools and features that streamline their web-based workflows, save time, and make common tasks faster and more efficient.
    *   **Tabitha provides:** Several productivity features, including:
        *   **Workspace-wide search** to quickly find saved items or open tabs.
        *   **Quick access** (e.g., via "New Tab Takeover").
        *   **Drag-and-drop** for easy organization and saving.
        *   Extensive and configurable **keyboard shortcuts** for most actions.
        *   Quick "Open" actions for saved links and groups.
